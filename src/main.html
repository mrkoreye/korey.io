        I worked for ShopStyle, a fashion search engine, for 3.5 years. During my time there I ended up as the tech lead for the 
        ShopStyle Collective product, an affiliate program that helps thousands of influencers monetize their blogs and social networks.
        My team and I built and maintained a hybrid mobile app, an angular app for the web, and some embeddable 'widgets' that influencers
        could place on their blogs to get paid when people clicked.
        Check out some of the features like analytics and look creation in the video below.

        The metronome for the hungry, on the go musician. I jumped head first into this one to learn more about React and the web audio context.
        It's a metronome that has a few different click sounds, lets you accent the first beat, change time signatures, and adjust the volume.
        All while you get to watch a cartoon cookie get eaten - what else could you need :P

      <div class="details-title">WRANGLER</div>
      <p>
        Wrangler first started as a little side project of mine but then blossomed into one of the main testing tool for ShopStyle and POPSUGAR.
        The idea for Wrangler came about when I was frustrated with the current manual testing setup we had - a bunch of excel docs.
        Wrangler gets ticket and fix version data from the Jira API, then puts it all together in a place where people can easily see what they need to test.
        People write test plans in the Jira ticket, and whoever gets assigned that ticket goes through the steps and passes or fails the test plan.
        Tickets can have multiple test plans, minimum numbers of testers, and there is logic to make sure people get assigned randomly but not to their own ticket.
        Meteor was an idea choice because it is built with real time in mind, so as people are testing it updates everyone's browser.
        The video below demonstrates the basic flow of test setup by an admin and testing by a user, and the beloved little reward of a gif when you complete all tests.

        I wanted my band's website to be super simple, load fast, and get straight to the point. 
        I also chose to take inpiration from the <a href="http://brutalistwebsites.com/">brutalist</a> websites out there I like to browse sometimes.
        All the javascript and styles are injected straight into the page, meaning the only external dependencies are the images. 
        Also, it's just one page! Nice and simple.

        Well, I'm not gonna lie. This one is pretty silly. I resurrected an old game of snake I made in 2013, refactored into ES6 land, added audio, and made it into a standalone 404 error page.
        The goal of the game is to collect all of Bach's "lost notes" so you can help him write one of the solo violin sonatas.
        One of the more fun parts was working with the Web Audio API to make a little synth that could read notes in the format 'Bb4-C4-D4' and translate it into tones.
        This snake game is kind of tricky to get the hang of, especially on mobile. It has a little bit of that "it's hard so it's fun" thing that flappy bird had.
        If you get all the notes, you get to hear the whole tune in glorious 8-bit (is that the right number?) tone!

        Lyrical Miracle was the first app I built after completing App Academy in September 2013. 
        It is a clone of Rap Genius - a place where people can upload lyrics to songs and annotate them.
        I haven't touched the code since 2013, and it currently lives on a free dyno tier on Heroku. 
        Just a warning: free heroku tiers are super slow, so it might take a while to load if you check out the live site.
